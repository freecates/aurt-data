**COOKIES POLICY**

Access to this Website may involve the use of cookies. Cookies are small amounts of information that are stored in the browser used by each User – on the different devices that may be used to browse – so that the server remembers certain information that will later be read only by the server that implemented it. Cookies make browsing easier, friendlier, and do not damage your browsing device.

Cookies are automatic procedures for collecting information relating to the preferences determined by the User during their visit to the Website in order to recognise them as a User, and to personalise their experience and use of the Website, and they can also, for example, help to identify and resolve errors.

The information collected through cookies may include the date and time of visits to the Website, the pages viewed, the time spent on the Website and the sites visited just before and after the Website. However, no cookie allows it to be contacted with the User's telephone number or with any other means of personal contact. No cookie can extract information from the User's hard drive or steal personal information. The only way for the User's private information to be part of the Cookie file is for the User to personally give that information to the server.

Cookies that allow a person to be identified are considered personal data. Therefore, the Privacy Policy described above will apply to them. In this sense, the User's consent will be required for the use of the same. This consent will be communicated, based on an authentic choice, offered by an affirmative and positive decision, prior to the initial, removable and documented treatment.

**First-party cookies**

These are cookies that are sent to the User's computer or device and managed exclusively by AÜRT for the better functioning of the Website. The information collected is used to improve the quality of the Website and its Content and your User experience. These cookies allow the User to be recognised as a recurring visitor to the Website and to adapt the content to offer content that suits their preferences.

**Third-party cookies**

These are cookies used and managed by external entities that provide AÜRT with  services requested by AÜRT to improve the Website and the user's experience when browsing the Website. The main objectives for which third-party cookies are used are to obtain access statistics and analyse browsing information, i.e. how the User interacts with the Website.

The information obtained refers, for example, to the number of pages visited, the language, the place where the IP address from which the User accesses, the number of Users who access, the frequency and recurrence of visits, the time of visit, the browser they use, the operator or type of device from which the visit is made. This information is used to improve the Website, and detect new needs to offer Users Content and/or service of optimal quality. In any case, the information is collected anonymously and reports are prepared on trends of the Website without identifying individual users.
