  "secondTextBlock": "An effective technique and the use of the minimum ingredients. A natural and clear kitchen. Many times of Japanese inspiration and Mediterranean materialization. The escape of Play Food, the topic and juggling. A limited interventionism and the suppression of the insubstantial. Some insinuating simplicity and nakedness. The alternative perspective of food and tradition, and the nonnegotiable binomial temporality-freshness. The exoticism of proximity and the dignity of everyday life. The emotional, sincere and conceptual prevails over the technical. The dynamic and direct sequences. And to base and deepen our discourse without interference."
