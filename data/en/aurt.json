          "bioText": "<strong>Aürt</strong> is a word that perfectly expresses the 'exoticism of proximity' that inspires the cuisine of Artur Martínez. Apparently exotic, it is a Catalan term without translation that means to hit abruptly against something. Short, resounding and direct. It is a little known and used name. The word dates from the thirteenth century and its origin is uncertain, probably pre-Roman and Indo-European, from a very developed base in Celtic. A linguistic rooting like that of Artur with its origins. In addition, both share the same letters. The umlaut (two points) symbolizes a 2.0, as the chef's obsession to evolve."

The will is to be transparent through a set design according to Artur's essential way of cooking. Both rehearsal and function will be held, in full view of everyone. We cook most dishes in the same two tables that house a total of 15 people."
