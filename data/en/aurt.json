Apparently exotic, it is a Catalan term without translation that means to hit abruptly against something. Short, resounding and direct. It is a little known and used name. The word dates from the thirteenth century and its origin is uncertain, probably pre-Roman and Indo-European, from a very developed base in Celtic. A linguistic rooting like that of Artur with its origins. In addition, both share the same letters. The umlaut (two points) symbolizes a 2.0, as the chef's obsession to evolve."

Informal means two things: something that has no seriousness or protocol, and something that does not respect the norms or fulfill its commitments. We are serious with the responsibility of covering any expectation of the customer, however small. And we respect an internal protocol. But we will reinterpret the norms established by haute cuisine that we do not like."
