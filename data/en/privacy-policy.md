**Categories of Personal Data**

The categories of data processed in AÜRT are only identifying data. Under no circumstances are special categories of personal data processed within the meaning of Article 9 of the GDPR.

**Legal basis for processing personal data**

The legal basis for the processing of personal data is consent. AÜRT undertakes to obtain the User's express and verifiable consent for the processing of his/her personal data for one or more specific purposes.

The User shall have the right to withdraw his/her consent at any time. It will be as easy to withdraw consent as it is to give it. As a general rule, the withdrawal of consent will not condition the use of the Website.

On the occasions in which the User must or can provide their data through forms to make queries, request information or for reasons related to the content of the Website, they will be informed in the event that the completion of any of them is mandatory because they are essential for the correct development of the operation carried out.

**Purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended**

Personal data are collected and managed by AÜRT in order to be able to facilitate, expedite and comply with the commitments established between the Website and the User or the maintenance of the relationship established in the forms that the latter fills in or to respond to a request or query.

Likewise, the data may be used for a commercial purpose of personalisation, operational and statistical, and activities specific to the corporate purpose of AÜRT, as well as for the extraction, storage of data and marketing studies to adapt the Content offered to the User, as well as to improve the quality, operation and navigation of the Website.

If the child is under 14 years of age, the consent of the parents or guardians will be required for the processing, and this will only be considered lawful to the extent that they have authorized it.

**Secrecy and security of personal data**

AÜRT undertakes to adopt the necessary technical and organisational measures, according to the level of security appropriate to the risk of the data collected, in order to guarantee the security of personal data and to prevent the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed,  or unauthorized disclosure of or access to such data.

The Website has an SSL (Secure Socket Layer) certificate, which ensures that personal data is transmitted securely and confidentially, as the transmission of data between the server and the User, and in feedback, is fully encrypted or encrypted.

However, because AÜRT cannot guarantee the impregnability of the internet or the total absence of hackers or others who fraudulently access personal data, the Data Controller undertakes to notify the User without undue delay when a personal data security breach occurs that is likely to pose a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. In accordance with Article 4 of the GDPR, a personal data breach is defined as any security breach that results in the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or the unauthorized disclosure of or access to such data.

Personal data will be treated as confidential by the Data Controller, who undertakes to inform and to guarantee by means of a legal or contractual obligation that such confidentiality is respected by its employees, associates, and any person to whom the information is accessible.

**Rights derived from the processing of personal data**

The User has the  following rights over AÜRT and may, therefore, exercise the following rights against the Data Controller recognised in the GDPR and Organic Law 3/2018, of 5 December, on the Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights:

- *Right of access:* This is the User's right to obtain confirmation as to whether  or not AÜRT is processing their personal data and, if so, to obtain information about their specific personal data and the processing that AÜRT has carried out or is carrying out, as well as, among others, the information available on the origin of said data and the recipients of the communications made or planned to be made of them.
- *Right to rectification:* This is the User's right to have their personal data modified that turn out to be inaccurate or, taking into account the purposes of the processing, incomplete.
- *Right to erasure ("the right to be forgotten"):* It is the User's right, provided that current legislation does not establish otherwise, to obtain the erasure of their personal data when they are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or processed; the User has withdrawn their consent to the processing and this has no other legal basis; the User opposes the processing and there is no other legitimate reason to continue with himself; the personal data has been processed unlawfully; personal data must be deleted in compliance with a legal obligation; or the personal data have been obtained as a result of a direct offer of information society services to a minor under 14 years of age. In addition to deleting the data, the Data Controller, taking into account the available technology and the cost of its implementation, must take reasonable steps to inform the Data Controllers who are processing the personal data of the data subject's request to delete any link to that personal data.
- *Right to restriction of processing:* It is the User's right to limit the processing of their personal data. The User has the right to obtain the restriction of processing when contesting the accuracy of his/her personal data; the processing is unlawful; the Data Controller no longer needs the personal data, but the User needs it to make claims; and when the User has objected to the processing.
- *Right to data portability:* In the event that the processing is carried out by automated means, the User will have the right to receive from the Data Controller his/her personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and to transmit them to another data controller. Whenever technically possible, the Data Controller will directly transmit the data to that other controller.
- *Right to object:* This is the User's right not to have their personal data processed or to cease  processing by AÜRT.
- *Right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling:* It is the User's right not to be subject to an individualized decision based solely on the automated processing of their personal data, including profiling, unless otherwise provided for by current legislation.
